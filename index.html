<u><h2>For our collaborators:</h2></u>
<p>Dear Sir / Madam,<br><br>
We are second year undergraduate students from University Malaya. We are currently undertaking 
Thinking and Communication Skills (WIX2001) course this semester and the course requires us to conduct a 
Service-Learning Malaysia (SULAM) project.
<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Our project is a reading campaign called ‘Young Reads’. We proudly to invite your students in our 
    upcoming event. Our project is Young Reads, where we will work together with the students and hold story reading sessions, do a summary
     writing session and impromptu story telling competition. <br><br>
     A few words about our project: We realized that COVID-19 on top of digital normalization has made the 
     current generation almost devoid of books and text material, as they spend most of their time on 
     social media or games. Besides the latter software undoubtedly providing better stimuli and 
     enjoyment to their users compared to books, the absence of face-to-face education further 
     diminishes the presence of books in the lives of children today. Therefore, Young Reads aims to 
     rekindle the interest of reading in children by going out of our way in this busy university life 
     to read meaningful stories to them. Moreover, we hope to improve the reading, listening, 
     and thinking skills of the students through this event. <br><br>
     Having that said, we would like to humbly request for your support as we organise this event. 
     We are plainly undergraduates, but with your assistance, the odds of achieving wonders might not 
     be that feeble after all. <br><br>
     Quoting the worlds from King Solomon, the wisest king that ever lived, 
     "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it".
      We believe there is a necessity to instil the habit of reading in children of this generation, 
      and we want to contribute to this necessity as much as we can. Your reply is much anticipated, 
      thank you for reading this message.</span></p>
